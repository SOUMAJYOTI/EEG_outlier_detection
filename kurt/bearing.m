% Function bearing:	 									   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function  generates  the bearing response function. %
% For that, it uses the known first 3 resonance frequencies%
% 120rad/s, 500rad/s & 1500rad/s. 						   %
% It  does  so  by getting the response to each frequency, %
% using the function lsim, and then it adds up each response
% to get the overall response.							   %
% It  also  calculates the  Gain  response  of the overall %
% system, using the Bode representation.				   %
% It returns the overall response, Y, and the time vector-t,
% and  the 	Frequency 	and Gain 	vectors of  the  Bode  %
% representation. 										   %
