% Function pulse_out	 								   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function generates a signal which represents a fault%
% on the outer ring of the bearing. According to  what  we %
% know, it is composed of fast pulses which occur at times %
% which are  dependant  on  the  rotation velocity of  the %
% bearing. 												   %
% It also adds noise to the signal, which  represents  the %
% measurement noise.									   %
% It gets the rotation speed (in RPM), and returns the time%
% vector - t, along with the generated signal - P.		   %
