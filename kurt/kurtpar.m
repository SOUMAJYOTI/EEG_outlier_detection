% Function kurtpar:	 						 			   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function gets Y signal and t time vector as inputs. %
% It  filters  the  signal according to original resonance %
% frequencies, and performs a kurtosis claculation of each %
% filtered signal.                                         %
% Finally, it sends the 3 kurtosis calculations as K1,K2,K3%
% outputs.                                                 %
